# How to contribute ? 

1. Set up Qt (if already done then skip this step)
   - Start by download and installing the Qt SDK from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download). I decided to go with the Open Source version
   - Qt Creator is a sort of an IDE with internal build tools. So currently, it's a good idea to install this.
   - We will not be using CMake since QMake comes bundled with the creator

2. clone/download the repository

3. Open ```QtCalculator => calculator.pro``` using Qt creator

4. Once inside Qt creator click on ```configure Project``` options (it will configure the project according to your device) üëá

5. that's it you are good to go üëç

## ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è
do not include any ```.pro.user``` file while uploading your file (It contain the stuff your system added to configure the project according to your device)
repository should be clean and should only contain usefull information
